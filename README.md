The hard copy and electronic version of your group report must indicate all group members’ ID number, Surname and First name in the first page or at the beginning of program file (as comments).

If you think there is a good reason for late submission, such as illness, and you have supporting documentary evidence then you should follow the “mitigating circumstance” procedures outlined in the Red Book, otherwise assignments will NOT be accepted by the module Organizer after the due date.

Extracts from University: Regulations on Cheating, Plagiarism and Collusion

Section 2.3: “The following broad types of offence can be identified and are provided as indicative examples”
(i) 	Cheating: including taking unauthorized material into an examination; consulting unauthorized material outside the examination hall during the examination; obtaining an unseen examination paper in advance of the examination; copying from another examinee; using an unauthorized calculator during the examination or storing unauthorized material in the memory of a programmable calculator which is taken into the examination; copying coursework.
(ii)	Falsifying data in experimental results.
(iii)	Personation, where a substitute takes an examination or test on behalf of the candidate. Both candidate and substitute may be guilty of an offence under these Regulations.
(iv)	Bribery or attempted bribery of a person thought to have some influence on the candidate’s assessment.
(v)	Collusion to present joint work as the work solely of one individual.
(vi)	Plagiarism, where the work or ideas of another are presented as the candidate’s own.
(vii)	Other conduct calculated to secure an advantage on assessment.
(viii)	Assisting in any of the above.

Some notes on what this means for students:

1.	Copying another student's work is an offence, whether from a copy on paper or from a computer file, and in whatever form the intellectual property being copied takes, including text and computer programs.

2. 	Taking extracts from published sources without attribution is an offence. To quote ideas, sometimes using extracts, is generally to be encouraged. Quoting ideas is achieved by stating an author's argument and attributing it, perhaps by quoting, immediately in the text, his or her name and year of publication, e.g. " e = mc2 (Einstein 1905)". A references section at the end of your work should then list all such references in alphabetical order of authors' surnames. (There are variations on this referencing system, which your tutors may prefer you to use.) If you wish to quote a paragraph or so from published work then indent the quotation on both left and right margins, using an italic font where practicable, and introduce the quotation with an attribution. 

 
CS6003ES – Advanced Software Engineering COURSEWORK PART 1

SUBMISSION DEADLINE:  

1.	Description and requirements: 

You are required using an appropriate approach to analyse, design, implement and test the software for the scenario described below:

Scenario

City Taxi’s focus the low to mid income range passengers in Island wide city areas. The target passengers are motivated to use City Taxi services over that of competitors because of the convenience and quality associated with the provided services.
Taxi reservation criteria
City Taxi believes that passengers choose their cab service based on the following criteria:
•	Performance. Get passengers where they want to go, when they want to go, promptly, efficiently, comfortably, and safely.
•	Superior Service. Timely pick up, private usage, and customer care.
•	Quality. This involves providing courteous service in clean, well-maintained vehicles.
You are required to design a web-based system to reserve taxis for “City Taxi (PVT) Ltd”.  

General requirements for City Taxi (PVT) Ltd are as follows:

1.	Passengers and vehicle owners/ drivers can register with the on-line system. Once registered, they receive an email with the username and password.
2.	Passengers can reserve taxis through the website. Once reserved, they receive an SMS to with the driver and the vehicle details.
3.	Drivers are always logged in to the web-based system through their smart phones except if they are ‘BUSY’ state. 
4.	Passengers can rate drivers based on their experience on trips with them. 
5.	Drivers can show their availability by choosing the ‘AVAILABLE’ and then they will be added to the available drivers list automatically. Once they picked a hire, driver should change the status to ‘BUSY’.
6.	City Taxi uses a telephone operator to reserve drivers manually. This option is given for unregistered passengers with the system. Once they booked over the phone, customer details will not be shown on the trip. But customer details must be recorded in the system along with the contact number and a SMS is received once the booking is confirmed. 
7.	The software should show the list of drivers closest to the passenger and the passenger can select the driver from the list.
8.	Drivers’ location is automatically retrieved by the web-based system and the passengers’ location is set when a reserving a taxi.  (by the passenger or the operator).
9.	The payment for the journey will be automatically calculated by the system and passenger can pay for the journey through the system at the end. The driver will receive a message after successful payment.


Group Tasks (55%):
1.	System architecture design with the communication Diagram. 
2.	Software requirements specification should clearly indicate the Potential requirements and the hidden requirements (including required reports). Obtaining awareness about travel reservation mechanisms would be highly important.
3.	Software design and its specification using UML with Object Oriented Analysis Design techniques.
4.	Use of collaborative software tools and groupware for the development is highly encouraged.
Individual Task (45%):
1.	Each member of the group must implement a part (more than two components) of the software, such as interface including login function, daily report software. 
2.	Each member of the group must test your implemented software. It includes software-testing design (With Test cases), test implementation and test report. 
3.	Each member should demonstrate his/her contribution inside the collaborative software development tools (Git, Test management software like JIRA, Google cloud software etc.). 
This coursework also requires each group to give a group presentation in week 10 and an individual presentation in week 17. The requirements for presentation have been included in the Marking Scheme.

2.	Submission: 
By the deadline you must submit an electronic version and the hardcopy of the complete documentation and software.
